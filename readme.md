## Overview â†“

voidjs was built with <a href="https://emotion.sh">emotion</a> and it's direct environment was and should be React. It can be forked and build for plain JavaScript, Vue and whatever else you needs, but It's highly recommended to do it with another name. I'd love if voidjs stays React-only.
